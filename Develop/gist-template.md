# Regex Tutorial 

With this tutorial I will explain what a Regex is and how its constructed.  

## Summary

Regex, short for regular expression, is a string of text used for creating a pattern that helps 
match, locate, and manage text.

Here is an example of a Regex Matching an HTML Tag â€“  /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

## Regex Components

### Anchors
/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/ 

The ^ and $ are anchors used to start and end our string expression

### Quantifiers

/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

Quantifiers specify how many instances of a character, group, or character class must be present in the input for a match to be found.
The + and * are quantifiers in this expression, the + is used to match one or more times of the preceding element in this case [a-z] and [^<].
The * is used to match zero or more times of its preceding element, in this case ([^<]+).

### OR Operator

/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

The | operator matches elements before or after it, in this case > OR \s .
